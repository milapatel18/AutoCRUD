Completely Dynamic AUTO CRUD Development with core concept of Spring Boot API, Database, ORM/JDBC, REST.
Design Patterns : 

Requirement : 
- Connect and configure database in UI - 
- Select Database in UI and show all the tables
- Diaplay all the tables in side panel and manage crud operations for each table
- Manage 1-M relationship in dropdown menu with single select options ( Display ID with 4 columns value in tabular Mode )
- Manage all the form Components based on metadata of the table columns e.g. Numbers, Text, TextArea, 

Backend : 
- Use MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Use different packages for managing metadata services and connections
- Use seamless API design for CRUD
- Save Database details to the filesystem only

Technology Stack : 
- Spring Boot 3.*, Java 17.*, MySQL 8.*,
